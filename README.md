This repository will be used for faculty projects in Faculty of technical sciences on the subject called "Distributed Control Systems". A distributed control system (DCS) is a computerised control system for a process or plant usually with a large number of control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is a central operator supervisory control.  The DCS concept increases reliability and reduces installation costs by localising control functions near the process plant, with remote monitoring and supervision.

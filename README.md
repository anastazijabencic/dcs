This repository will be used for faculty projects in Faculty of Technical Sciences for the subject called "Distributed Control Systems". A distributed control system (DCS) is a computerized control system for a process or plant usually with a large number of control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is a central operator supervisory control.The DCS concept increases reliability and reduces installation costs by localizing control functions near the process plant, with remote monitoring and supervision.
